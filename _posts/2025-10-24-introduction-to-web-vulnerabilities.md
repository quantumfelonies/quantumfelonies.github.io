# Introduction to Web Vulnerabilities

Every website has hidden weak spots—small mistakes in code or setup that hackers can exploit. These are called **web vulnerabilities**.

They show up in different ways:  
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)** – attackers slip harmful code into database queries  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – injecting scripts into web pages  
- **CSRF** – tricking users into unwanted actions  
- **Broken Authentication** – weak login or session handling  
- **Security Misconfigurations** – poor server or app settings  

Knowing these isn’t just for cybersecurity pros. If you build or manage websites, understanding the basics helps you avoid the easy traps. Web security starts with awareness.
