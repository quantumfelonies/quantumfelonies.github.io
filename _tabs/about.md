## Hey, Iâ€™m **Charis Orony**

Iâ€™m a computer science grad who loves building cool, secure, and user-friendly applications.  
I mix **software engineering**, **UI/UX design**, and a bit of **ethical hacking** to create digital experiences that actually work (and look good doing it).

### ðŸ’¡ What I Do
- Build clean and efficient web apps  
- Design intuitive, user-centered interfaces  
- Test and secure systems through ethical hacking  
- Explore IoT and automation projects  
- Solve problems with a creative, hands-on approach
- Collaborate on cross-disciplinary tech projects  

When Iâ€™m not coding or sketching interfaces, Iâ€™m usually reading about emerging tech, tweaking side projects, or figuring out how to make something work just a little smarter.
